## Why Box was written
I saw that noone has ever written a package manager for Linux distros in JavaScript/Node.js, so I thought it would be a fun challenge.

## The advantages of box
- **Very lightweight**, it weighs around 200kb.
- **Fast**, it only uses 2 node packages, which were specifically selected for speed.
- **Easy to use**, box only contains 4 needed commands: **install**, **remove**, **help**, and **search**.
